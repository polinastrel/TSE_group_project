# TSE_group_project
In this project we replicate GK paper (influence of monetary shocks) with different instruments and time periods. 
The first part (Task1) is devoted to reproducing the article on ready-made data. We were able to replicate the original graphs, however, FOMC data was not as informative as we expected.
Extension and bonus parts (Task2 & Task3) enlarge the original GK setup to longer samples and additional events (FOMC meetings and speeches) in order to test the robustness of the baseline monetary policy shocks. In our implementation, these extensions work only partially: because we cannot reconstruct the authors’ original high-frequency surprises, the new instruments are weaker and the resulting IRFs do not closely match the benchmark GK responses.
